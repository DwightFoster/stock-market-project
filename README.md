# This is a simple DQN based trading bot I created. 
### WARNING USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. I DO NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY MONEY LOST USING THIS BOT. THIS IS JUST A STARTER BOT. TRADE AT YOUR OWN RISK
It is not that great but it is a cool starter program if you are trying to do something like this. It uses a on policy dqn to make trading decisions.
It is passed data scraped from finviz.com. WARNING ALL DATA FROM FINVIZ IS DELAYED BY 15 MINUTES. The model is a combination of an lstm and a linear layer.
The LSTM is passed the price data for the stock while the linear layers are passed information about the company and the amount of money it has. 

If someone wants me to make a video going over everything in it I will happily do so. You can email me at this address with any questions or requests: dwightf404@gmail.com. 

## AGAIN I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY MONEY LOST USING THIS BOT. IT IS A BASIC BOT I CREATED JUST TO SEE HOW WELL IT COULD DO. USE IT ON THE STOCK MARKET AT YOUR OWN RISK.
